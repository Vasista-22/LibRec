 first compile and run create_lists.c
  
 you'll have the following files created
  
   1.comp_list.txt  : having the computer list
   2.withdrawn.txt  : to be removed from the computer list
   3.accession.txt  : containing original accession numbers
   4.physical.txt   : for now it just contains random numbers

 you can make changes manually to comp_list.txt by adding characters anywhere
 except at the begining of the file.

 *compile and run lib.c

 your comp_list.txt gets modified by removal of withdrawn numbers

 *compile and run phase2.c

 certain accession register numbers which are previously not in comp_list.txt
 gets added

 *finally compile and run 3rd_phase.c

 here duplicate removal will be done for physical.txt and missing books from
 physical.txt gets inserted in a new file called missing.txt
